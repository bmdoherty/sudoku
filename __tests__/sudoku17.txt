Tools Used
 Choosing tools to make JavaScript applications is significant part in the process of building modern JavaScript applications

	vscode
		Modern IDE for JavaScript, makes developer environment better

	Node
		Glue that binds modern JavaScript development together

	react
		Popular SPA framework

	babel-preset-env : Fine grained targeting of  browsers ability to write in es7 and deploy to older browsers
		["last 2 versions", "safari >= 7"]
		> 5% (by market share)

	webpack
		Create distribution to be used in browsers /dist. Even though I write the the solver engine in es7

	prettier
		Code formatting, decide on set on rules and keep to them. Differences of opinion about what rules are then becomes something to discuss. 
		All developers get same formatting based on rules. 

	eslint
		Check for known common problems in the code

	jest
		react unit testing framework, code coverage

	travis-ci: 

		Continuous integration. test, build code, deploy when everything passes to https://bmdoherty.github.io/sudoku-react/#

	GitHub.io : 
		example of “cloud” deployment

	husky
		Pre commit hooks. Stop problems before the commit, linting, prettier, tests, builds supported

	jsDoc: not used currently but something maybe for the future
		create documentation using code comments

	Overall thinking
		Developers interact with git and the code, the deployment and testing is done via processes in the build
		Give developers freedom and confidence to make changes, knowing their changes will be checked and tested before hitting production.
		Its not developers problem alone if production is broken, it is problem in how the process of deployment is done. Its problem of how we work as a team
